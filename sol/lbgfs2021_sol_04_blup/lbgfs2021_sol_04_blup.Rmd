```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r prob1-init, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
s_data_url <- "https://charlotte-ngs.github.io/lbgfs2021/data/beef_data_blup.csv"
```

## Problem 1: Linear Models
Read the dataset given in `r s_data_url` using the function `readr::read_csv()`. 


### Tasks

* Do a descriptive statistics on the given data
* Fit fixed linear models for `herd`, `sex` and both factors as fixed effects.


### Solution

The data is read and stored in memory as a datastructure called `tibble`.

```{r}
tbl_data_blup <- readr::read_csv(file = s_data_url)
```
