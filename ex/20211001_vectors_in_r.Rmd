This notebooks shows how to work with vectors in R

Given are the following two vectors $v$ and $w$. Compute

* the sum $v+w$, 
* the difference $v-w$ and 
* the dot product $v\cdot w$. 

$$v = \left[\begin{array}{c}
   3  \\ 
  -5  \\ 
   1  \\ 
   9  \\
  \end{array}\right]
$$

and 

$$w = \left[\begin{array}{c}
    1  \\ 
    9  \\ 
  -12  \\ 
   27  \\
  \end{array}\right]
$$
