# Problem 1: Inverse Numerator Relationship Matrix
During the lecture the method of computing the inverse numerator relationship matrix $A^{-1}$ directly was introduced. The computation is based on the LDL-decomposition. As a result, we can write 

$$A^{-1} = (L^T)^{-1} \cdot D^{-1} \cdot L^{-1}$$
where $L^{-1} = I-P$, and $D^{-1}$ is a diagonal matrix with $(D^{-1})_{ii} * \sigma_u^{-2} = var(m_i)^{-1}$.  


## Tasks

* Use the example pedigree given below and compute the matrices $L^{-1}$ and $D^{-1}$ to compute $A^{-1}$
* Verify your result using the function `getAinv()` from package pedigreemm.


## Pedigree

```{r}
nr_animal <- 6
tbl_pedigree <- tibble::tibble(Calf = c(1:nr_animal),
                               Sire = c(NA, NA, NA, 1 ,3, 4),
                               Dam = c(NA, NA, NA, 2, 2, 5))
tbl_pedigree
```


## Solution


# Problem 2: Rules
The following diagram helps to illustrate the rules for constructing $A^{-1}$

```{r inv-num-mat, echo=FALSE, hook_convert_odg=TRUE, fig_path="odg", out.width="100%"}
#rmdhelp::use_odg_graphic(ps_path = "odg/inv-num-mat.odg")
knitr::include_graphics(path = "odg/inv-num-mat.png")
```
 

## Tasks

* Go through the list of animals in the pedigree and write down the contributions that are made to the different elements of matrix $A^{-1}$ 
* Based on the different contributions, try to come up with some general rules
