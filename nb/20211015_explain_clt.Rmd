# Disclaimer
This notebook gives a graphical explaination of the central limit theorem and shows its consequences for quantitative genetics.


# Sampling
Take a number of random numbers from the uniform distribution and sum them up. Repeat that for a given number of times and look at the distribution of the sums.


# Example

```{r}
n_nr_random_numbers <- 100
n_nr_repeat <- 10
vec_random_numbers <- runif(100)
sum_random_numbers <- sum(vec_random_numbers)

```
